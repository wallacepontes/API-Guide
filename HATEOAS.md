# HATEOAS

## What is HATEOAS principle?

HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a principle in RESTful web services that allows clients to dynamically discover and navigate through the available resources and actions offered by the server, without having prior knowledge of the URL structure. This is achieved by including links within the responses from the server, which provide the client with information about the available actions, along with their URIs. HATEOAS helps to decouple the client from the server, allowing for greater scalability and flexibility in the development of web services.

## And Contract First or Contract Last

Contract First and Contract Last are two approaches to defining the structure of an API (Application Programming Interface) in a web service. 

Contract First refers to the practice of defining the structure of an API in a machine-readable format, such as XML or JSON schema, before writing any implementation code. This contract is then used as the blueprint for the implementation of the API on both the server and client side. The benefit of this approach is that it enables the development of an API that adheres to a well-defined structure and behavior, and helps to ensure that the API will meet the needs of clients who use it.

Contract Last, on the other hand, involves writing the implementation code first, and then generating the API definition from the code. This approach is often favored in situations where the development of the API is driven by specific business needs and requirements, and the structure and behavior of the API emerge as the implementation evolves.

Both approaches have their benefits and trade-offs, and the choice between them depends on the specific needs and requirements of the API and the organization developing it.
