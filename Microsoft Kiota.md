# Kiota

Microsoft Kiota
Kiota is a client generator for HTTP REST APIs described by OpenAPI. The experience is available as a command-line tool and as a Visual Studio Code extension. Kiota helps eliminate the need to take a dependency on a different API client for every API that you need to call, as well as limiting the generation to the exact API surface area youâ€™re interested in, thanks to a filtering capability.
