# API Management

## What is API Management?

API Management refers to the process of designing, publishing, documenting, and monitoring application programming interfaces (APIs) in a secure, scalable, and efficient manner. It involves the use of specialized tools and platforms to manage the entire lifecycle of APIs, including:

1. API Design: Creating well-defined, consistent, and easy-to-use API interfaces that meet the needs of developers and consumers.

2. API Publication: Making APIs available to developers and consumers through a centralized portal or marketplace, where they can discover, explore, and subscribe to APIs.

3. API Documentation: Providing comprehensive documentation, including guides, tutorials, and reference materials, to help developers understand how to use the APIs effectively.

4. API Security: Implementing security measures such as authentication, authorization, encryption, and rate limiting to protect APIs and prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

5. API Monitoring: Continuously monitoring the performance, availability, and usage of APIs to identify issues, optimize performance, and ensure service level agreements (SLAs) are met.

6. API Analytics: Collecting and analyzing data on API usage, traffic patterns, errors, and other metrics to gain insights into how APIs are being used and to inform decision-making and optimization efforts.

API Management platforms and tools provide a centralized solution for organizations to manage their APIs effectively, streamline development efforts, and facilitate collaboration between API providers and consumers.

## What is Apigee?

Apigee is Google Cloud's native API management platform that can be used to build, manage, and secure APIs — for any use case, environment, or scale. 

Apigee is an API (application programming interface) management platform from Google. It provides a set of tools and resources for businesses and developers to create, manage, and analyze their APIs in an efficient and scalable way.

Some of Apigee's key features include:

1. API Management: Allows companies to create and manage their APIs, defining security policies, access limits and traffic monitoring.

2. Data analysis: Provides detailed insights into the use of APIs, allowing companies to identify trends, issues and opportunities for improvement.

3. Application development: offers tools so that developers can create applications using the APIs available on the platform.

4. API Security: Includes features to protect APIs against cyber threats such as DDoS attacks (Distributed Denial of Service attacks), Structured Query Language (SQL) injections, and other types of attacks.

Apigee is widely used by companies across a variety of industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, transportation, and many others. It allows companies to focus on their core business while managing the technical aspects related to APIs.
