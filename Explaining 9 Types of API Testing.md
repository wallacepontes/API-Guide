# Explaining 9 Types of API Testing

ğŸ”¹ Smoke Testing
This is done after API development is complete. It simply validates if the APIs are working and nothing breaks.

ğŸ”¹ Functional Testing
This creates a test plan based on the functional requirements and compares the results with the expected outcomes.

ğŸ”¹ Integration Testing
This test combines several API calls to perform end-to-end tests. It tests intra-service communications and data transmissions.

ğŸ”¹ Regression Testing
This test ensures that bug fixes or new features don't break the existing behaviors of APIs.

ğŸ”¹ Load Testing
This tests an application's performance by simulating different loads. It helps calculate the capacity of the application.

ğŸ”¹ Stress Testing
This deliberately creates high loads on the APIs to test if they are able to function normally under stress.

ğŸ”¹ Security Testing
This tests the APIs against possible external threats to ensure security.

ğŸ”¹ UI Testing
This tests the UI interactions with the APIs to make sure the data is displayed properly.

ğŸ”¹ Fuzz Testing
This injects invalid or unexpected input data into the API and tries to crash it. This helps identify API vulnerabilities.
